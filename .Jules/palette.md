## 2024-05-22 - Mobile Menu Accessibility
**Learning:** Legacy mobile menus often use `div` elements, requiring conversion to semantic `<button>` tags with `aria-expanded` states and specific CSS resets (background, border, padding) to maintain visual fidelity while improving accessibility.
**Action:** When identifying interactive `div`s, check for keyboard accessibility and screen reader support, and prioritize refactoring to semantic HTML.
